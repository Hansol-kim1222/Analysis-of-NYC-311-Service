Analyze New York City's 311 Service Data Using Tableau
The data I am going to analyze is NYCâ€™s 311 service request data. 311 is New York City's non-emergency call center that allows residents to make service requests, file complaints, and get additional information about the City. Also 311 serves to handle requests such as  connecting residents, business owners, and visitors with the information and people who need help. 311 was launched in 2003, but the city opened the data to the public in 2010. Therefore, the data records start from 2010 but I am going to use data from 2019 to present. The dataset contains 7.6 million requests.
Since the dataset size is too big, I am not able to upload the file here. 
But if you want to see and download the dataset, you can visit https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02893
